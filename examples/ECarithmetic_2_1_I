Prime p: 2 
positive integer m: 4
if(m>1), irreducible polynomial of deg m: x^4+x+1
element A- degree of A, followed by co-efficients: x^3 
element B- degree of B, followed by co-efficients: x^3 + 1
type 1, so no input for C
degree d: 1
P (x1,y1): (0010, 1111) which is (x,x^3+x^2+x+1)
Q (x2,y2): (1100, 1100)
T (x3,y3): (0001, 0010) //It is not a point, you may check that (0001, 0001) is a point
